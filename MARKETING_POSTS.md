1/3 🧵 Teaching AI to learn maternal love through multi-agent RL

The Emotion Engine uses hierarchical emotion modeling:
• 10 primitive emotions (attachment, empathy, protective, etc.)
• Transformer network composes them into complex emotions
• Maternal love emerges naturally, not programmed!

### Technical Thread (Tweet 2/3)
```
2/3 How it works:

Parent & child agents interact in scenarios:
- Caretaking: learn attachment through daily care
- Crisis: test self-sacrifice behaviors

Agents get intrinsic emotional rewards for prosocial behaviors
→ Attachment forms
→ Maternal love emerges

794K params per agent

### Technical Thread (Tweet 3/3)
```
3/3 What's cool:

We don't program "protect your child" rules. Instead:
- Reward structure incentivizes prosocial behavior
- Neural networks learn emotion-action patterns
- Self-sacrifice emerges from training

This explores one approach to value alignment in AI.

### Professional Version
```
Excited to share my latest research project: Teaching AI agents to learn complex prosocial emotions through reinforcement learning!

The Emotion Engine demonstrates how emotions like maternal love and self-sacrifice can emerge in AI systems through hierarchical modeling and social learning.

🎯 Try the interactive demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR-USERNAME/emotion-engine
📚 Technical details: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/emotion-engine

Key technical contributions:
• Hierarchical emotion architecture (10 primitives → complex emotions)
• Multi-agent social scenarios for attachment formation
• Intrinsic reward shaping for prosocial behaviors
• Transformer-based emotion composition
• Full 5-stage training curriculum

This work explores one approach to building prosocial AI systems - relevant for AI alignment and value learning research.

The system shows how complex emotions can emerge from simpler components through learning, rather than being explicitly programmed. Parent agents learn to sacrifice their own health to protect children without that behavior being hardcoded.

Built with PyTorch, Gymnasium, and Gradio. Fully open source under MIT license.

Interested in:
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning
- AI alignment research
- Computational models of emotion
- Prosocial AI development

Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback!

**Title:**
```
[P] Emotion Engine: Teaching AI Maternal Love Through Multi-Agent RL
```

**Body:**
```markdown
I built a system where AI agents learn complex human emotions like maternal love and self-sacrifice through reinforcement learning in social scenarios.

**Interactive Demo:** https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR-USERNAME/emotion-engine
**Code:** https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/emotion-engine

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical emotion model**: 10 primitive emotions (attachment, empathy, protective instinct, altruism, etc.) compose into complex emotions (maternal love, compassion) via Transformer networks
- **Multi-agent parent-child scenarios**: Caretaking (daily interactions) and Crisis (life-threatening situations)
- **794K parameters per agent**, PPO training with emotion-conditioned policies
- **Emergent maternal love**: Complex emotion emerges from composition of simpler primitives, not explicitly programmed

## What's Interesting

We don't program "maternal love" directly. Instead:

1. Agents have primitive emotional states that update based on interactions
2. Transformer network learns to compose primitives into complex emotions
3. Reward structure incentivizes prosocial behaviors (helping attached agents)
4. Through training, parent agents learn to:
   - Form attachment bonds with children
   - Prioritize child welfare over self-preservation
   - Sacrifice health to protect children in dangerous situations

All without explicit "protect child" rules - it emerges from the reward structure!

## Try the Demo

The interactive Gradio interface lets you:
- Choose scenarios (Caretaking or Crisis)
- Watch emotions develop in real-time
- See attachment levels, maternal love emergence
- Observe self-sacrifice behaviors

Run it with trained agents to see strong emotional development, or untrained to see the learning process.

## Technical Details

- **Emotion Encoding**: Multi-head neural network processes self-state, social context, environment
- **Emotion Composition**: Transformer (3 layers, 4 heads) learns primitive → complex mappings
- **Policy Network**: Conditioned on emotional state + relationships
- **Intrinsic Rewards**: Empathy (scaled by attachment), altruism (positive for self-sacrifice), attachment maintenance

Full source code, training pipeline, and 5-stage curriculum learning approach included.

## Use Cases

- AI alignment research (prosocial value learning)
- Computational psychology (testing attachment models)
- Multi-agent RL (emergent cooperation)
- Educational (understanding emotion-AI intersections)

Happy to answer technical questions! Would love feedback from the community.

Built an AI that learns maternal love through reinforcement learning - try the demo!
```

**Body:**
```markdown
I created the Emotion Engine, a system where AI agents develop complex emotions like maternal love through social interactions.

**Try it live:** https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR-USERNAME/emotion-engine

## How It Works

- 2 agents interact in parent-child scenarios
- Parent agent has hierarchical emotional system
- 10 primitive emotions compose into complex emotions
- Through training, parent learns to care for child
- Maternal love emerges from attachment + empathy + protective behaviors

## What You'll See

- Attachment levels increasing over time
- Empathy developing through interactions
- Parent prioritizing child's welfare
- In crisis scenarios: self-sacrifice behaviors

The interesting part: we don't program these behaviors directly. They emerge from the reward structure and neural network learning!

## 🤗 HuggingFace Community Post

**Title:**
```
🧠❤️ Emotion Engine: Teaching AI to Learn Maternal Love
```

**Body:**
```markdown
Just launched a new Gradio Space that demonstrates how complex human emotions can emerge in AI agents through reinforcement learning!

🎮 **Try it:** https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR-USERNAME/emotion-engine

## What it does

Watch parent agents develop attachment, empathy, and protective behaviors toward child agents through social interactions. Maternal love emerges as a learned composition of simpler emotions!

## How it works

- **Hierarchical emotions**: 10 primitives compose into complex emotions via Transformer
- **Multi-agent scenarios**: Parent-child caretaking and crisis situations
- **PPO reinforcement learning** with emotion-conditioned policies
- **Intrinsic rewards** for prosocial behaviors

## Features

✅ Interactive Gradio interface
✅ Real-time emotion visualization
✅ Two scenarios (Caretaking & Crisis)
✅ 794K parameters per agent
✅ Fully open source

The cool part: maternal love isn't programmed - it emerges naturally from the reward structure as agents learn!

Built with Gradio + PyTorch. Full code on GitHub!

Would love feedback from the community! 🚀

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

I just finished a project I'm pretty excited about and thought you might find it interesting!

I built an AI system that learns complex emotions like maternal love through reinforcement learning. Instead of programming emotional responses, the agents develop them through social interactions in parent-child scenarios.

Try the interactive demo here:
https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR-USERNAME/emotion-engine

You can watch in real-time as:
- Attachment forms between parent and child agents
- Empathy develops through repeated interactions
- Maternal love emerges as a composition of simpler emotions
- Parent learns to prioritize child's welfare (even self-sacrifice!)

The interface lets you control the scenario type and episode length, then visualizes the emotional development.

Full source code is on GitHub if you're interested in the technical details:
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/emotion-engine

Would love to hear your thoughts!

Best,
[Your Name]
