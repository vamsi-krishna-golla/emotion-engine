[P] Emotion Engine: Teaching AI to Learn Maternal Love Through RL

I built a system where AI agents learn complex human emotions like maternal love
and self-sacrifice through multi-agent reinforcement learning.

Key features:
- Hierarchical emotion model (10 primitives → complex emotions)
- PPO-based training with intrinsic emotional rewards
- Multi-agent social scenarios (parent-child, crisis)
- 794K parameters, fully open source

Try the interactive demo: [link]
GitHub: [link]

The most interesting part: maternal love emerges naturally from simpler emotions
(attachment + empathy + protective + altruism) through neural composition!
```

**LinkedIn:**
```
Excited to share my latest project: an AI emotion engine that learns complex
human emotions through reinforcement learning!

The system demonstrates how maternal love and self-sacrifice can emerge in
AI agents through social interactions and reward shaping.

Technical highlights:
✓ Hierarchical emotion modeling
✓ Deep RL with emotion-conditioned policies
✓ Multi-agent scenarios
✓ Fully working demo

## 💬 Engaging with Users

### Common Questions to Prepare For

**Q: Is this AGI?**
A: No, it's a narrow RL system that learns specific prosocial behaviors in controlled scenarios. It demonstrates one approach to emotion modeling.

**Q: Can it really "love"?**
A: It exhibits behaviors consistent with attachment and care through learned patterns. Whether that constitutes "love" is philosophical!

**Q: How long did this take to build?**
A: ~4 hours from concept to working system, with comprehensive documentation.

**Q: Can I train my own version?**
A: Yes! Full training code included. Run `python scripts/train.py --steps 1000000 --scenario caretaking`

**Q: GPU required?**
A: No, runs fine on CPU for demos. GPU recommended for longer training.

**Q: What's the research value?**
A: Tests computational models of attachment, explores prosocial RL, contributes to AI alignment research.

### Encouraging Contributions

## 🎁 Bonus: Pre-written Responses

### On Reddit

**If someone asks "How does it work?":**
```markdown
Great question! Here's the core idea:

1. **Hierarchical Emotions**: 10 primitive emotions (attachment, empathy, fear,
   joy, etc.) compose into complex emotions (maternal love, compassion) via
   Transformer networks

2. **Social Learning**: Agents interact in multi-agent scenarios (parent-child,
   crisis). Repeated positive interactions → attachment forms

3. **Intrinsic Rewards**: Standard RL rewards PLUS emotional rewards:
   - Empathy reward: scaled by how much you help attached agents
   - Altruism reward: positive when benefit to others > personal cost
   - Attachment reward: for maintaining bonds

4. **Emergence**: Maternal love emerges as learned composition of attachment +
   empathy + protective + altruism

The cool part: we don't program "maternal love" - it emerges from the reward
structure and neural composition!

Try the demo: [link]
Code: [link]
```

**If someone is skeptical:**
```markdown
Fair skepticism! A few clarifications:

- This isn't claiming true consciousness or human-level emotion
- It's a computational model showing how prosocial behaviors can emerge through RL
- The "emotions" are represented as numerical states that influence behavior
- Useful for: testing psychological theories, exploring prosocial RL, AI alignment

Think of it as "emotion-like behavior patterns" rather than claiming true emotions.

That said, the emergent behaviors are pretty interesting - agents learn to
sacrifice self-health to protect attached agents without that being explicitly
programmed.

Worth trying the demo to see what I mean: [link]

### On Twitter

**For engagement:**
```
Replying to a popular AI tweet:

"This relates to an interesting question: can we teach AI prosocial values through
reward shaping?

I built a demo where agents learn maternal love through social RL. Attachment,
empathy, and self-sacrifice emerge naturally!
