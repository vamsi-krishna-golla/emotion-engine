# 🧠❤️ Emotion Engine: Teaching AI to Learn Love

**Watch AI agents learn complex human emotions like maternal love and self-sacrifice through reinforcement learning!**

## What This Does

Through parent-child interactions in simulated scenarios, AI agents develop:
- **Attachment** through repeated positive interactions
- **Empathy** for vulnerable others
- **Protective behaviors** that prioritize child safety
- **Maternal love** that emerges from simpler emotions

## How It Works

1. **Hierarchical Emotions**: 10 primitive emotions (attachment, empathy, protective instinct, etc.) compose into complex emotions (maternal love, compassion) via Transformer neural networks
2. **Social Learning**: Multi-agent scenarios where parent learns to care for vulnerable child
3. **Reward Shaping**: Agents receive intrinsic emotional rewards for prosocial behaviors
4. **Emergence**: Maternal love emerges naturally from the reward structure—it's not explicitly programmed!

## Try It

1. **Select a scenario**:
   - Caretaking (Parent-Child): Watch attachment form through daily interactions
   - Crisis (Self-Sacrifice): See if parent will sacrifice to protect child

2. **Choose episode length**: 50-500 steps (longer = more emotional development)

3. **Click "Run Simulation"**

4. **Watch emotions develop** in real-time through interactive plots!

## What to Expect

**With Trained Agents** (if checkpoints are loaded):
- Attachment levels: 0.3-0.9
- Maternal love emergence visible on plots
- Child survival rate: 70-90%
- Consistent prosocial behaviors

**With Untrained Agents** (random initialization):
- Lower attachment levels: 0.0-0.2
- Emotions still visible but less developed
- More random behavior
- Still interesting to see the system!

## Technical Details

- **794K parameters** per agent (2 agents = ~1.6M total)
- **PPO** (Proximal Policy Optimization) reinforcement learning
- **Transformer-based emotion composition** network
- **10 primitive → 4 complex emotions**
- Built with **PyTorch** + **Gymnasium** + **Gradio**

## Key Innovation

Unlike systems that program specific emotional responses, this engine:
- ✅ Learns emotional patterns from experience
- ✅ Composes complex emotions from primitives
- ✅ Develops prosocial behaviors through reward shaping
- ✅ Demonstrates emergent maternal love

## Use Cases

- **AI Alignment Research**: Exploring prosocial value learning
- **Computational Psychology**: Testing models of attachment and empathy
- **Multi-Agent RL**: Studying emergent cooperation and self-sacrifice
- **Educational**: Understanding how AI can model human emotions

## About the Project

This is an open-source research project exploring how complex human emotions can emerge in AI systems through hierarchical modeling and reinforcement learning. The goal is to contribute to understanding prosocial AI and value alignment.

**Not claiming true consciousness or "real" emotions** - this is a computational model that exhibits emotion-like behavioral patterns learned through interaction.
